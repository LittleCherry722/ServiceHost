= ./screenshooter

The script uses slimerjs (or phantomjs) to create PNG screenshots of some pages
including the process view of all processes. In the console output all errors
from the JavaScript console will be shown (if any). The screenshots are
compared on a binary level to a set created previously, which you can store in
a directory called 'screenshooter-compare' in this directory.  This can be
handy to detect changes caused by updating JavaScript libraries or CSS rules.

After all screenshots are created the script will drop you in a new shell
started in the temporary directory with all scripts and the screenshots they
created, so you can easily inspect the screenshots or run specific scripts.
Exiting the shell automatically removes this temporary directory again.


= SlimerJS or PhantomJS?

PhantomJS ( http://phantomjs.org/ ) is a headless WebKit browser scriptable
with a JavaScript API.  SlimerJS ( http://www.slimerjs.org/ ) is a Gecko
browser (= Firefox) with an API compatible to PhantomJS. While the later isn't
headless, the former doesn't display all pages correctly currently.  It is
therefore adviseable to use SlimerJS if possible. As a bonus, it is also easier
to run as it can us a stock Firefox install while PhantomJS requires building
the browser engine statically.
